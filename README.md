This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
- To use this just set a postgres url on the `.env` file located at the root folder
- clone this repo, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`
- serve it and connect to it at `localhost:3000`
---
#### Used libs or packages:
- NextJs with typescript (React)
- Prisma for db with postgres
- Some more little things like FontAwesomeIcons and hashing things
### TODO:

- [ ]: Rows can store links so they have images for each group
- [ ]: Sort depending on sites or usernames
- [ ]: Be able to store data like if i logged in with google auth
- [ ]: Have a switch from old mode to new mode
- [ ]: Old mode will be rows and new mode will be beautiful cards
